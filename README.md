# YouSync (the name is temporary)

This project is a MERN-based service to watch YouTube videos in sync with your friends. It is mostly an experiment of me taking an unfamiliar stack and seeing how fast I adapt; you can use it for its main purpose once it's done, or tweak it however you want.

## Usage
To run a development version locally, you need to have npm installed and execute these commands in project root directory:  
```
npm install -g yarn
yarn ci
yarn dev
```
The client will be accessible on `http://localhost:3000`.  


To deploy a production version you'll need to use a Dockerfile that I will provide at a later point in development.
